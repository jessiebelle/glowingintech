### About the project: 
This project uses Django-based [Wagtail](http://docs.wagtail.io/) CMS for the backend with a React frontend and Redux store that connects to its [page API](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.2.2/advanced_topics/api/index.html). 



For deployment, add a local.py in the Django settings folder with SECRET_KEY and Database settings.
